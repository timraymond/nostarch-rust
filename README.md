Rust Programming Language
=========================

This is my repo for exploring through NoStarch's "The Rust Programming
Language" title by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols. It contains exercises, some
from the book, others I divised. All are organized by chapter though.

Running
-------

The examples can all be built and run by traversing into a project's
subdirectory and running `cargo run`. I'm not sure of a cleaner way of doing
this at the moment.

Contributing
------------

This is really my experiments. If you want to contribute to them, feel free to.
However, you'd probably be better served by re-creating some of these examples
by scratch.
